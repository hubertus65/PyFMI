    """
    Options for the solving the FMU using the Assimulo simulation package.

    Assimulo options::

        solver --
            Specifies the simulation algorithm that is to be used.
            Default: 'CVode'

        ncp    --
            Number of communication points. If ncp is zero, the solver will
            return the internal steps taken.
            Default: '500'

        initialize --
            If set to True, the initializing algorithm defined in the FMU model
            is invoked, otherwise it is assumed the user have manually invoked
            model.initialize()
            Default is True.

        write_scaled_result --
            Set this parameter to True to write the result to file without
            taking scaling into account. If the value of scaled is False,
            then the variable scaling factors of the model are used to
            reproduced the unscaled variable values.
            Default: False

        result_file_name --
            Specifies the name of the file where the simulation result is
            written. Setting this option to an empty string results in a default
            file name that is based on the name of the model class.
            result_file_name can also be set to a stream that supports 'write',
            'tell' and 'seek'.
            Note that depending on choice of result_handling the stream needs to
            support writing to either string or bytes.
            Default: Empty string

        with_jacobian --
            Determines if the Jacobian should be computed from PyFMI (using
            either the directional derivatives, if available, or estimated using
            finite differences) or if the Jacobian should be computed by the
            chosen solver. The default is to use PyFMI if directional
            derivatives are available, otherwise computed by the chosen
            solver.
            Default: "Default"

        jacobian_mode --
            How PyFMI evaluates the Jacobian when 'with_jacobian' is in
            effect and the FMU provides directional derivatives:
            "dd" uses the directional derivatives (one call per colour group
            of the sparsity pattern), "fd" uses coloured forward differences
            (one rhs evaluation per colour group) instead, "auto" measures
            the cost of one directional-derivative call against one rhs
            evaluation at initialization and picks "fd" when a directional
            derivative is the more expensive of the two, except for solvers
            that need the exact Jacobian (RodasODE), for the sparse linear
            solver, and for rtol below 1e-7 where the finite-difference
            truncation error would degrade Newton convergence. Without
            directional derivatives the Jacobian is always "fd". The mode
            that was used is available as the 'jacobian_mode' attribute of
            the algorithm object.

            On FMUs whose directional derivatives cost more than an rhs
            evaluation "fd" halves the simulation time of CVode and
            Radau5ODE on 100-300 state models at unchanged accuracy. The
            finite differences are protected by a kink guard
            (FMUModelME2.fd_kink_guard): without it a difference taken
            across a kink of the model (a limiter, a property-function
            region boundary) corrupts the Newton matrix for many steps.
            Default: "auto"

        dynamic_diagnostics --
            If True, enables logging of diagnostics data to a result file. This requires that
            the option 'result_handler' supports 'dynamic_diagnostics', otherwise an
            InvalidOptionException is raised.
            The default 'result_handler' ResultHandlerBinaryFile supports 'dynamic_diagnostics'.
            The diagnostics data will be available via the simulation results and/or the
            binary result file generated during simulation.
            Default: False

        logging --
            If True, creates a logfile from the solver in the current
            directory and enables logging of diagnostics data to logfile or resultfile,
            based on simulation option 'result_handling'.

            FMI3: Only logging to result file is supported.

            The diagnostics data is available via the simulation results similar to FMU model variables
            only if 'result_handler' supports 'dynamic_diagnostics'.
            Default: False

        result_handling --
            Specifies how the result should be handled. Either stored to
            file (txt or binary) or stored in memory. One can also use a
            custom handler.

            If 'result_handling' is 'binary', and 'logging' is also enabled,
            the diagnostics data is written to the same binary file as data of FMU model variables.
            Note that these results are interpolated such that model variable trajectory points
            are given at the same time points as diagnostics data.
            Available options: "file", "binary", "memory", "csv", "custom", None
            Default: "binary"

        result_handler --
            The handler for the result. Depending on the option in
            result_handling this either defaults to ResultHandlerFile
            or ResultHandlerMemory. If result_handling custom is chosen
            This MUST be provided.
            Default: None

        result_max_size --
            Maximum size of the stored result (in bytes). This is not a hard limit, the
            actual size will be slightly larger to account for that the result need to
            be consistent.
            Default: 2e9 (2GB)

        return_result --
            Determines if the simulation result should be returned or
            not. If set to False, the simulation result is not loaded
            into memory after the simulation finishes.
            Default: True

        result_store_variable_description --
            Determines if the description for the variables should be
            stored in the result file or not. Only impacts the result
            file formats that supports storing the variable description
            ("file" and "binary").
            Default: True

        filter --
            A filter for choosing which model variables to actually store
            result for. The syntax can be found in
            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29 . An
            example is filter = "*der" , stor all variables ending with
            'der'. Can also be a list.
            Default: None

        synchronize_simulation --
            If set, the simulation will be synchronized to real-time or a
            scaled real-time, if possible. The available options are:
                True: Simulation is synchronized to real-time
                False: No synchronization
                >0 (float): Simulation is synchronized to the factored
                            real-time. I.e. factor*real-time

                Example: If, set to 10: 10 simulated seconds is synchronized
                         to one real-time second.
            Default: False


    The different solvers provided by the Assimulo simulation package provides
    different options. These options are given in dictionaries with names
    consisting of the solver name concatenated by the string '_options'. The most
    common solver options are documented below, for a complete list of options
    see, http://www.jmodelica.org/assimulo

    Options for CVode::

        rtol    --
            The relative tolerance. The relative tolerance are retrieved from
            the 'default experiment' section in the XML-file and if not
            found are set to 1.0e-4
            Default: "Default" (1.0e-4)

        atol    --
            The absolute tolerance.
            Default: "Default" (rtol*0.01*(nominal values of the continuous states))

        maxh    --
            The maximum step-size allowed to be used by the solver. The
            default caps the step at the communication-point spacing, which
            forces at least 'ncp' steps; None or 0.0 removes the cap and
            lets the solver's error control alone choose the step (also the
            default when ncp = 0).
            Default: "Default" (max step-size computed based on (final_time-start_time)/ncp)

        discr   --
            The discretization method. Can be either 'BDF' or 'Adams'
            Default: 'BDF'

        iter    --
            The iteration method. Can be either 'Newton' or 'FixedPoint'
            Default: 'Newton'

    Options for TRBDF2 (Assimulo >= 3.9, TR-BDF2 with Assimulo's event locator)::

        rtol, atol, maxh --
            As for CVode.

    Options for ARKODE (Assimulo >= 3.9 with SUNDIALS >= 7.1; SUNDIALS ARKODE's
    Runge-Kutta methods with ARKODE's rootfinding for state events)::

        rtol, atol, maxh --
            As for CVode.

        method  --
            'implicit' (diagonally implicit RK, Newton with the Jacobian) or
            'explicit' (explicit RK, for non-stiff models).
            Default: 'implicit'

        order   --
            The method order (implicit 2-5, explicit 2-9); ARKODE's default
            Butcher table of that order unless 'table' names one.
            Default: 4

        table   --
            Name of an ARKODE Butcher table, e.g. 'ARKODE_TRBDF2_3_3_2';
            overrides 'order'.
            Default: None

        external_event_detection --
            As for CVode (False: ARKODE's rootfinding).
            Default: False

        fallback_table, fallback_conv_fail_rate, fallback_window --
            When more than fallback_conv_fail_rate of the last fallback_window
            step attempts failed by Newton non-convergence (a rhs with a jump
            the solution rides on), the run continues with the 2-stage
            Butcher table fallback_table (None disables the fallback).
            Defaults: 'ARKODE_TRBDF2_3_3_2', 0.25, 50

        implicit_states --
            With method 'imex': the states whose derivatives form the implicit
            (stiff) part, as a list of state variable names or glob patterns
            (e.g. ['suspension*', 'tire[*'] or state indices; the rest is the
            explicit part. The derivative dependencies of the FMU split the
            implicit states into blocks that do not depend on each other's
            states (several fast subsystems that only interact through the
            explicit part, e.g. a vehicle's suspensions through the body); the
            Newton matrix is then factored block by block (ARKODE's
            linear_solver 'BLOCK', the default when there is more than one
            block) and the implicit Jacobian is coloured on its rows alone.
            Default: None

        implicit_blocks --
            Overrides the derived blocks: a list of lists of state names or
            patterns, each a block. A given block may merge derived blocks
            but never split one; validated against the dependencies.
            Default: None (derived)

        partial_rhs --
            How the two parts of the rhs are evaluated: True, each part as a
            get_real request on its derivatives (cheap only on an FMU compiled
            with lazy evaluation); False, one full rhs evaluation per point
            serves both parts; 'auto', decided by timing a partial request
            against a full evaluation at initialization (partial if below half).
            Default: 'auto'

        Every other ARKODE property (predictor, max_nonlin_iters, ...) can be
        added to the dictionary and is passed through.
    Options for Radau5ODE::

        rtol, atol, maxh --
            As for CVode.

        thet    --
            Newton contraction rate above which the Jacobian is recomputed
            after an accepted step (0 < thet < 1). Assimulo's default 1e-3
            recomputes it after almost every step; with the PyFMI Jacobian
            ('with_jacobian' in effect) the default is 0.1, which halves the
            Jacobian evaluations on models where Newton converges slowly.
            Default: "Default" (0.1 with the PyFMI Jacobian, else Assimulo's 1e-3)

    Options::


        ncp    --
            Number of communication points.
            Default: '500'

        initialize --
            If set to True, the initializing algorithm defined in the FMU model
            is invoked, otherwise it is assumed the user have manually invoked
            model.initialize()
            Default is True.

        stop_time_defined --
            If set to True, the model cannot be computed past the set final_time,
            even in a continuation run. This is only applicable when initialize
            is set to True. For more information, see the FMI specification.
            Default False.

        write_scaled_result --
            Set this parameter to True to write the result to file without
            taking scaling into account. If the value of scaled is False,
            then the variable scaling factors of the model are used to
            reproduced the unscaled variable values.
            Default: False

        result_file_name --
            Specifies the name of the file where the simulation result is
            written. Setting this option to an empty string results in a default
            file name that is based on the name of the model class.
            result_file_name can also be set to a stream that supports 'write',
            'tell' and 'seek'.
            Default: Empty string

        result_handling --
            Specifies how the result should be handled. Either stored to
            file (txt or binary) or stored in memory. One can also use a
            custom handler.
            Available options: "file", "binary", "memory", "csv", "custom", None
            Default: "binary"

        result_handler --
            The handler for the result. Depending on the option in
            result_handling this either defaults to ResultHandlerFile
            or ResultHandlerMemory. If result_handling custom is chosen
            This MUST be provided.
            Default: None
        
        result_max_size --
            Maximum size of the stored result (in bytes). This is not a hard limit, the
            actual size will be slightly larger to account for that the result need to
            be consistent.
            Default: 2e9 (2GB)

        return_result --
            Determines if the simulation result should be returned or
            not. If set to False, the simulation result is not loaded
            into memory after the simulation finishes.
            Default: True

        result_store_variable_description --
            Determines if the description for the variables should be
            stored in the result file or not. Only impacts the result
            file formats that supports storing the variable description
            ("file" and "binary").
            Default: True

        time_limit --
            Specifies an upper bound on the time allowed for the
            integration to be completed. The time limit is specified
            in seconds. Note that the time limit is only checked after
            a completed step. This means that if a do step takes a lot
            of time, the execution will not stop at exactly the time
            limit.
            Default: none

        filter --
            A filter for choosing which model variables to actually store
            result for. The syntax can be found in
            http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_%28programming%29 . An
            example is filter = "*der" , stor all variables ending with
            'der'. Can also be a list.
            Default: None

        silent_mode --
            Disables printouts to the console.
            Default: False

        synchronize_simulation --
            If set, the simulation will be synchronized to real-time or a
            scaled real-time, if possible. The available options are:
                True: Simulation is synchronized to real-time
                False: No synchronization
                >0 (float): Simulation is synchronized to the factored
                            real-time. I.e. factor*real-time

            Example: If, set to 10: 10 simulated seconds is synchronized

    Options::

        tolerance    --
            The tolerance for the estimation algorithm
            Default: 1e-6

        method       --
            The method to use, available methods are methods from:
            scipy.optimize.minimize.
            Default: 'Nelder-Mead'

        scaling      --
            The scaling of the parameters during the estimation.
            Default: The nominal values

        simulate_options    --
            The simulation options to use when simulating the model
            in order to get the estimated data.
            Default: The default options for the underlying model.

        result_file_name --
            Specifies the name of the file where the result is written.
            Setting this option to an empty string results in a default
            file name that is based on the name of the model class.
            result_file_name can also be set to a stream that supports 'write',
            'tell' and 'seek'.
            Default: Empty string

        result_handling --
            Specifies how the result should be handled. Either stored to
            file (txt or binary) or stored in memory. One can also use a
            custom handler.
            Available options: "file", "binary", "memory", "csv", "custom", None
            Default: "csv"

        result_handler --
            The handler for the result. Depending on the option in
            result_handling this either defaults to ResultHandlerFile
            or ResultHandlerMemory. If result_handling custom is chosen
            This MUST be provided.
